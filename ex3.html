    <p>
        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
        that
        conforms to the ECMAScript
        standard.[10]
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).

        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides <span class="js">JavaScript</span>
        APIs for I/O.

        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core
        components of some servers and a
        variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
